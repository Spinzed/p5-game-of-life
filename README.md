# Game of Life
Conway's Game of Life remade in JavaScript library React.js among many other utilities

## Installation Guide
This project is configured as a NPM (Node Packet Manager) project  

### Prerequisities for the project configuration:  
-- NodeJS with NPM - version 10.0+ (Note: version 6.0 should work, but it hasn't been tested)  
Website: https://nodejs.org

### Project Setup
If all prerequisities are correctly installed, proceed to setup the project itself.  
After cloning this repository, open a terminal and enter these commands:  
```
npm install
```  
This will install all libraries and dependencies required. It should be run only once.  
To ready the project for use, enter the following command:  
```
npm start
```  
This will start a local development NPM server. __Do NOT use this server for development since it is broken at the time being. Open the index.html manually or setup your own development server__

## Additional Notes
This is just a small side-project which I use to learn about React and web development in general. Feel free to contribute to this project, give any suggestion etc.
